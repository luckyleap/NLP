## Yelp Dataset Challenge
This is the final project for the nlp class.
The goal is to classify categories of yelp businesses based on user reviews on the restaurant.

The project's base case will be an implementation of the naive bayes and bag of words approach to make each word
a feature and predict the maximum likelihood estimate using simple term frequencies.
