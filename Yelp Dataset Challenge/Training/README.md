#Training for Yelp Dataset
This is the folder which holds all the scripts for training the dataset of the yelp dataset challenge

##Input
The training file will be the preprocessed output from the preprocessing script: **YelpDataSetup.py**. The default preprocessed output from the YelpDataSetup.py is:

  * **business.json**
```
Example:
{
  "ID":123,
  "Num Words":2430,
  "Term Frequencies":
      {
        "service":123,
        "to":240,
        ...
      }
}
```
  * **category.json**
```
Example:
{
  "Category":"Grocery",
  "Num Businesses":40,
  "Business IDs":
  {
    "123",
    "456",
    ...
  }
}
```
##Implementation
The basic training implementation will be using the bag of words and naive bayes approach to create a maximum likelihood estimation of the category given a review.

The algorithm used is the multinomial model that can be referred in the final report in the folder above.
